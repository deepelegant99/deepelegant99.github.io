# [Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/deepelegant99/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/master/boston-housing)

This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a recommendation system for a movies dataset.

* Data was taken from the movielens dataset 
* The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques. 
* Algorithms Used : K-Nearest Neightbours, TF-IDFS, Singular Value Decomposition Model (SVD), Alternatining least Square (ALS) 
* Optimised the SVD & ALS model. 
* The Project Write-up is published on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3791837)
